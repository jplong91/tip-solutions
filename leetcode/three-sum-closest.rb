### Question
# https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/
#
# Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target,
# find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
#
# Return the sum of the three integers.
#
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
#
# Input -> array (of integers) and single integer
# Output -> integer (sum)
#
# Input: [-1, 2, 1, -4], target = 1
# Output: 2
#
# Input: [-3, 5, 9, -6, -2, 4, 7], target = 6
# Output: 7?
#
# Input: [0, 0, 0], target = 1
# Output: 0
#

### Pseudocode
#
# create method `closest_three_sum` with `nums` param and `target` param
# hmm, are we using a nested, nested loop here? probably yes for first implementation
#

def closest_three_sum(nums, target)
  
end

p closest_three_sum([-1, 2, 1, -4], 1) #=> 2


### Final Form
#

def closest_three_sum_ii(nums, target)
  
end

p closest_three_sum_ii([-1, 2, 1, -4], 1) #=> 2
